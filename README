parse was created by Ariel Villanueva Jr(822661691) on 4 DEC 2023 for CS530, Fall 2023 for Assignment 3. The program was submitted utilizing Edoras account: cssc2607

DESCRIPTION:
The project consists of the following files: 
bison2.y
lexy.l
makefile
test.txt
README

The program is written in c and can be compiled with the ‘make’ command. The program utilizes flex and bison to decide if each line qualifies as an assignment or an expression. 

PROPER COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT:
./parse <filename>

ERRORS CAUGHT:
There must be at least one file passed and any un-openable / non-existent files will throw runtime errors.

BUGS/ISSUES:
Errors are caught, but I was not able to figure out how to let people know exactly what they did wrong beyond that they had a syntax error on a specific line.

LESSONS LEARNED:
An introductory knowledge of flex and bison was gained as well as a better understanding of macros and lexical analysis.
